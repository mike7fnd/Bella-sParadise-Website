# TODO: Make Admin Dashboard Data Real from DB

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Update `controllers/authController.js`: Modify `adminDashboardPage` to fetch real data from DB (revenue, bookings today, occupancy, pending check-ins, recent bookings).
- [ ] Update `views/admin-dashboard.xian`: Replace hardcoded stats and table with dynamic Handlebars variables.
- [ ] Test the admin dashboard to ensure data loads correctly and calculations are accurate.
